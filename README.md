# Hall Magnetic Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Hall Magnetic Sensor project demonstrates how to use a Hall Effect sensor module with an Arduino Mega to detect the presence of a magnetic field. The Hall Effect sensor outputs a digital signal indicating whether a magnetic field is present or not. This project includes setup instructions and Arduino code to read and display the sensor's output on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Hall Effect Sensor Module**
3. **Magnet (for testing)**
4. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Hall Effect Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin** (typically marked as OUT) of the Hall sensor to a digital pin on Arduino Mega (e.g., hallSensorPin)
   - **VCC** of the Hall sensor to **5V** on Arduino Mega
   - **GND** of the Hall sensor to **GND** on Arduino Mega

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - No external libraries are required for this project.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Hall Effect sensor module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Bring a magnet close to the Hall sensor to observe changes in the sensor output displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Proximity Detection:** Detect the presence or absence of magnetic objects or devices.
- **Position Sensing:** Monitor the position of magnetic elements in various applications.
- **Security Systems:** Implement magnetic switches for door/window security systems.
- **Automotive:** Use in automotive applications for sensing position or proximity of magnetic components.

#### Notes

- Ensure the correct orientation and placement of the magnet relative to the Hall sensor for reliable detection.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control the frequency of readings based on your application requirements.
- Experiment with different magnets and distances to understand the sensor's sensitivity and range.
